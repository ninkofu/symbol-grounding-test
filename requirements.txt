# Core dependencies for the symbol grounding test project
#
# The versions below are indicative; adjust as needed when building
# a fully working system.  Some packages (e.g. torch, diffusers)
# are heavy and may not install in minimal environments; they are
# included here to signal intent rather than being strictly required
# for the current stubs.

torch>=2.0
numpy>=1.23
Pillow>=9.0
# diffusers and transformers would be needed to connect to a real
# diffusion backend and LLM models, but are optional for the
# placeholder implementation.  Uncomment when ready.
# diffusers>=0.20
# transformers>=4.28
