# The versions below are indicative; adjust as needed when building
# a fully working system.  Some packages (e.g. torch, diffusers)
# are heavy and may not install in minimal environments; they are
# included here to signal intent rather than being strictly required
# for the current stubs.

Pillow>=9.0
# Diffusion backend dependencies
diffusers>=0.24
transformers>=4.35
